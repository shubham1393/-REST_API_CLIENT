#In today's software development landscape, interacting with external systems and services via APIs has become a critical skill. One of the most common types of APIs used in application development is a REST API, which follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). REST APIs are lightweight and typically provide access to resources in formats such as JSON or XML. This problem statement focuses on developing a Java application that consumes data from a public REST API, such as weather data, and displays it in a structured format. This task will not only help in learning how to communicate with external services but also introduce concepts like handling HTTP requests, parsing JSON data, and displaying results in a user-friendly format.

In this scenario, the Java application will interact with a publicly available weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI, to fetch real-time weather information. These APIs offer endpoints that provide data on temperature, humidity, weather conditions, wind speed, and more. The application will send a GET request to one of these endpoints and retrieve the data in JSON format. Java's built-in libraries like HttpURLConnection or HttpClient (Java 11 and above) can be used to handle the HTTP request, while libraries like Jackson or Gson will help in parsing the JSON response into Java objects.

Once the application receives the data, it needs to extract the relevant information such as the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), and wind speed. The data can then be structured into a readable format and displayed to the user. For instance, a simple text-based output could show the temperature in Celsius, humidity level, and weather description. This structured format allows users to quickly understand the weather conditions, making the application both practical and efficient.

Error handling is another important aspect of this application. Since the communication between the Java application and the API depends on external factors such as network connectivity and valid API keys, the program must account for potential issues like invalid API responses, rate limiting, or lack of network access. Robust error handling will ensure that the application doesn't crash unexpectedly and can provide meaningful messages to the user in case of failure.

The end result is a simple yet functional application that demonstrates how to interact with public APIs, handle HTTP requests, parse JSON data, and present the information to the user in an organized way. For developers, this project serves as an essential practice in dealing with real-world data integrations. Furthermore, it can be extended into more advanced applications, such as adding graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to display the data more interactively, or even integrating other types of external APIs for enhanced functionality. This task not only reinforces Java programming skills but also provides valuable experience in building applications that consume and present data from external sources, a core competency in modern software development.
